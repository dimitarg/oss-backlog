Public list of stuff I want to do when I have time. Not necessarily ordered

- https://github.com/functionaljava/functionaljava/issues/318
- https://github.com/functionaljava/functionaljava/issues/319
- immutable.js support for https://github.com/fritz-c/react-sortable-tree. Generically, decouple react-sortable-tree from wheter data is Vanilla js object, immutable js object, etc; allow for arbitrary data
